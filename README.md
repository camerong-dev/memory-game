# Memory Game

Memory Game is a site that tests your memory by viewing cars and attempting to match them. 

## Project Goals

- Build a front-end game with a simple UI for a user to interact with

## Site Structure

Memory Game is a single page site, with the page consisting of a 4x4 grid containing logos of car manufacturers. 

## Colour Scheme

My colour scheme follows a basic palette of colours using greys and blues. I used [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to generate random colour palettes to find a colour which stood out to me. From there I used [ColourSpace](https://mycolor.space/) to create a variety of colour palettes based of the intial colour.

Final Colour Palette:



## Fonts

The only font I used was imported into style.css from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Nunito was used for my h1 and button element for the simplistic appearance. Sans-serif was the backup due to the basic design, which would not seem out of place if it were present.

## Features

- 4x4 grid containing all cards for the game. Upon clicking a card, a flipping animation will occur. 
- Reset button at the bottom of the page which allows the user to reset upon completing the game.

## Future Features

- Click to start game
- Timer starting at 90 seconds
- A running total of flipped cards
- You won / lost notification
